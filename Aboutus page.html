            <h1>Who Are We?</h1>
            <p>
                We are a team of students from [Your Institution Name], working together on our Joint Group Assignment (JGA) 2025. Our project is dedicated to tackling food insecurity in South Africa by researching and promoting community, school, and household gardening initiatives.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a group, we believe that gardens are more than just spaces for plants. They are spaces of hope, learning, and empowerment. Through this project, we aim to bring together research, technology, and community action to support the fight against hunger and poverty.
